🍏 **Apple Leaf Disease Classification** 🌿

🌱 **Introduction**

Biodiversity conservation isn't just about protecting forests and wildlife—it starts at the leaf level. Apple trees, like many other plant species, are vital to ecosystems and agriculture. However, leaf diseases threaten their health, impacting biodiversity and agricultural productivity. This project leverages Deep Learning to classify apple leaf diseases, contributing to Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) efforts by enabling early disease detection and intervention.

🛠 **Project Overview**

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ResNet to classify apple leaf diseases based on images. The goal is to develop an automated, scalable, and efficient way to monitor plant health, replacing manual inspection methods that are often time-consuming and inconsistent.

📂**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asheniranga/leaf-disease-dataset-combination/data) and contains images of apple leaves categorized into 4 different disease types. The dataset was preprocessed, and augmented to improve model performance.

🧠 **Model Development**

CNN Model: A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network trained on the dataset.

ResNet Model: A deep learning model leveraging residual learning to improve accuracy.

Training & Evaluation: The models were trained using TensorFlow/Keras, and performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss curves.

📊 **Key Results**

Achieved high classification accuracy for apple leaf diseases.

CNN outperformed the ResNet model in terms of generalization and robustness.

The model provides a scalable solution for biodiversity monitoring in agriculture.

🌍 **Relevance to Biodiversity Net Gain**

By enabling early disease detection, this project supports BNG initiatives by helping reduce biodiversity loss in apple orchards. Healthier apple trees contribute to better ecosystem stability, improved air quality, and sustainable agriculture.
